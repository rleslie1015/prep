Hi Robby,

I hope all is well! It was really nice speaking with Iqbal and Hong last week.

I just wanted to follow up and see where you were in the hiring process for the Quality Engineer role. I’m still very interested in and excited about this opportunity, so please let me know if there’s anything else you need from me to help in making your decision.

Best,
Leslie Rodriguez
